## Homework assignment.
1. Create a free account in AWS. `# Done`
2. Create a machine (linux/docker) that on startup sends logs to Cloudwatch 
(system logs and special log that says "I'm up!"). `# System logs - Done, "I'm up!" via special metrics - Done`
3. Cloudwatch alert on the logs, when it receives "I'm up", it emails "The machine is up!" `# Done via metrics alert `
4. Build this infrastructure in Terraform. `# Done`

**Guidelines:**
- Security is very important to us. `# Security via firewall, keys and variables - Done`
- Try to be mindful of cost.  `# Ð¡ost reduction via Free tier eligible - Done`

**Super important:**
- The environment should be fully automated and be built and torn down with a script. `# Done via terraform apply/destroy except "Requirements" below` 
- Repo should include some documentation. `# Done via README.md and comments in code`
- The exercise should work out of the box without code tweaks according to the instructions you provided. `# Done`
- Submit this by April 20th. Send an email with a link to repo for review. `# Done by April 18th`
